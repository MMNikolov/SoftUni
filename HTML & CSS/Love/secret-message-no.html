            <p>This said in the last site was 100% true
            <br>I know i have made some terrible mistakes,
            <br>but i really do wanna believe in us again.
            <br>
            <br>There was a saying that goes:
            <br>"They always say that there are two kinds of love:
            <br>the one that you die for
            <br>and the one that you kill for"
            <br>But you made me realize
            <br>that the kind of love i want to have
            <br>is the one that you live for
            </p>
